Proposal:
1: My plan is to code a website with an interactive visual simulation of a black holeâ€™s physical dynamics.

2: In my creative project, I plan to explore the gravitational effects of black holes, including interactions with nearby celestial objects, gravitational lensing of the black hole, and other major phenomena. Additionally, the website will provide informative content and scientific explanations.
